 I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have, are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired are for a very long career. To make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you. Good luck.
